# Hi there, I'm Ibrahima 👋

I'm a **Data Engineer** passionate about designing, building, and optimizing modern data platforms.

I work across the entire data lifecycle — from ingestion and transformation to orchestration, storage, and performance tuning — with a strong focus on **reliability, scalability, and clean architecture**.

💡 I enjoy solving complex data challenges, implementing efficient pipelines, and enabling teams to make better decisions through **high‑quality, well‑structured data**.  
🚀 I'm continuously learning and exploring new tools in the data ecosystem to sharpen my skills and stay ahead of the curve.  
🌍 Based in France and open to new opportunities where I can contribute to impactful, data‑driven products.
