Hi there, I'm Ibrahima 👋
I’m a Data Engineer passionate about designing, building and optimizing modern data platforms.
I work across the full data lifecycle — from ingestion and transformation to orchestration, storage and performance tuning — with a strong focus on reliability, scalability and clean architecture.
💡 I enjoy solving complex data challenges, implementing efficient pipelines, and enabling teams to make better decisions through high‑quality, well‑structured data.
🚀 I’m continuously learning and exploring new tools in the data ecosystem to improve my craft and stay ahead of the curve.
🌍 Based in France and open to new opportunities where I can contribute to impactful data‑driven products.
